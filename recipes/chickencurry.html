        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>"This is a fantastic main dish for a South Indian meal, which should always be served with several dishes," says Anne-Marie. "Enjoy this chicken curry with curried green beans, parboiled or basmati rice, or a flat bread. The red chili powder called for here is NOT the same as the chili powder Americans use to flavor chili and tacos. This red chili powder is available from Indian grocery stores and is MUCH HOTTER."</p>
