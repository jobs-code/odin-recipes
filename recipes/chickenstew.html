        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 Â½ teaspoons black peppercorns, 4 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, 1 (1 inch) piece ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped, 3 green beans, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 14 ounces chicken breast, cut into small pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamom; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until browned, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Stir onion and bay leaf into the pot; cook, stirring constantly, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potato, carrot, green chile peppers, green beans, and salt. Stir in ground black peppers and turmeric. Cook, covered, for 3 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Stir chicken into the pot until evenly mixed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir coconut milk and green peas gently into the pot. Cook until heated through but not boiling, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
